BUGS:
    - If saving/destroying fails, the record is still added/removed to/from the internal collection leading to wrong data.
    - The 'modal-open' class is added to the body tag causing scrolling problems (overflow hidden).

IMPROVEMENTS:
    - performance: prevent to many re-render, don't init a new modal instance every time etc.

TODOS:
    - Dashboard
    - Views need refactoring (outsource tables etc.)
    - Some M2M relations lack the ability to add new records.
