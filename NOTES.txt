BUGS:

  [ ] Confirmation modal is not closed on "No" click
  [ ] Displayed data is not always correct for related data (@hasMany etc.). This is because things are often
    rendered before both Models are ready....tried various hacks, but a proper solution should be implemented
    in the models to listen for related events.
  [ ] Submitting forms does not trigger HTML5 validation in Safari


IMPROVEMENTS:

  [ ] Multi language support
  [ ] Smarter bootstrap-select (selectpicker) implementation


TODOS:

  [ ] Account page for non-admins so they can change the password
  [ ] Breadcrumb
  [ ] Dashboard : Maybe some charts (% of outdated binaries etc.)
  [ ] DataTables?
  [ ] Permissions Ã  la : can_create_users, can_delete_binaries ...
  [ ] Refresh button to re-fetch data from the server
  [ ] Tab tables count badge
  [ ] Tables pager so not all records are shown on one page
  [ ] WebSockets or ESS to get changes other users did
  [ ] Window title
