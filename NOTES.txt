BUGS:
    - Switching between different Spine.Stacks doesn't deactivate the current one and not activate the new's parent.
      Example: In ServerForm, click on either the binary or version.
    - The overriden save() method of Models resets the instance's values during the save process.
    - If saving/destroying fails, the record is still added/removed to/from the internal collection leading to wrong data.
    - bootstrap-select does not use checked=true attribute of the underlaying select options elements.

TODOS:
    - Dashboard
    - Views need refactoring (outsource tables etc.)
    - All M2M relations lack the ability to add new records.
    - Non-admin profile page needs to be implemented.
    - Non-admin users see the 'Delete' button (e.g. for roles) - should be hidden.
