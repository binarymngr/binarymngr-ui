BUGS:
    - Saving() doesn't update the record on the server, it is simply reset. Works when using std save() from Spine.Model
    - If saving/destroying fails, the record is still added/removed to/from the internal collection leading to wrong data.
    - bootstrap-select does not use checked=true attribute of the underlaying select options elements.

TODOS:
    - Dashboard
    - Views need refactoring (outsource tables etc.)
    - All M2M relations lack the ability to add new records.
    - Non-admin profile page needs to be implemented.
    - Non-admin users see the 'Delete' button (e.g. for roles) - should be hidden.
