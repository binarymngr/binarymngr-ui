TODOS:
  - Remove M2M related records on destroy (e.g. server when user is deleted).
    With the new 'fix' to re-add destroyed objects where the server reports an error that doesn't work.
  - Add some kind of breadcrumb
  - Smart solution to set the window title
  - Datatables Tables
  - Binaries sidebar highlighting
  - Submitting form does not trigger HTML5 validation
  - Chaning the password results in 401 (server-side)
  - Smarter bootstrap-select (selectpicker) implementation
