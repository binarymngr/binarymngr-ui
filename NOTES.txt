BUGS:
    - Adding a new binary version complains about missing binary_id. Might be because of bootstrap-select
    - If saving/destroying fails, the record is still added/removed to/from the internal collection leading to wrong data.
    - Dates are not formatted correctly.

TODOS:
    - Dashboard
    - Views need refactoring (outsource tables etc.)
    - All M2M relations lack the ability to add new records.
